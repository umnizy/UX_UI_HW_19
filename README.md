# UX_UI_HW_19


I tried really hard to push/clone this Repository from Visual Studio Code but it wasn't working so I uploaded the files manually. 
I did clone it to my Github desktop but when I committed changes for both HW18/HW19, nothing happened and I don't understand the coding language enough 
to understand what mistake I might be making. 
I have a lot yet to learn about this portion of the bootcamp. 
Luckily Sean Dant has offered to help out in the future, so then hopefully I can understand what it is that I'm doing wrong.
